## Python

- Guido [quits](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html) as BDFL.

- Of course it cannot not exist, but I finally stumbled upon the full PEP [list](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/). PEPs are Python Enhancement Proposals, some are accepted, some are implemented in the language, some are under discussion... I consider it is what makes the language alive. This time, I enjoyed reading again about:
    - [PEP 202](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0202/): List Comprehensions;
    - [PEP 3118](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/): Revising the buffer protocol;
    - [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/): Type Hints;
    - [PEP 557](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/): Data Classes (though I am not yet convinced);
    - [PEP 572](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/): Assignment Expressions;  
    Once it is implemented, my first intensive application will probably be:

```python
if (m := re.match("'https?://(?:[-\w.]|(?:%[\da-fA-F]{2}))+'", text)):
    a = m.group()
```

- GPU Accelerated, [CUDA Python](https://developer.nvidia.com/how-to-cuda-python);

- The [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) code formatter, by Łukasz Langa;

- The [pyre](https://pyre-check.org/) type-checker by Facebook, the new project to go beyond MyPy.

## Software Defined Radio

- [SoftFM](https://github.com/jorisvr/SoftFM), finally a good radio decoder software;

- [rtl_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433), to decode traffic from devices that are broadcasting on 433.9 MHz;

- [dumpvdl2](https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2), a VDL decoder, probably inspired by the ADS-B decoder [dump1090](https://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090/);

- [How to](https://tynet.eu/blog/how-to-receive-hrpt) decode High-Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT), and get great images like the excerpt above (from NOAA19 on May 6);

- a nice timeline on the website of the [Aireon](https://aireon.com/timeline/) company, deploying satellites to decode ADS-B messages from space to ensure a coverage over oceans and deserts.


## Machine Learning

- a [visual introduction](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2/) to Machine Learning;

- a late obituary for [Thomas Bayes](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/thomas-bayes-science-crisis/).

## Data visualisation -- Choice of colors

- What to consider when [choosing colors](https://blog.datawrapper.de/colors/) for data visualization;

- Make [grey](http://www.visualisingdata.com/2015/01/make-grey-best-friend/) your best friend.





## Miscellaneous

- Set a proper interacting environment between [tmux and vim](https://blog.bugsnag.com/tmux-and-vim/);

- It's Impossible to Prove Your Laptop Hasn't Been Hacked. [I Spent Two Years Finding Out](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/28/computer-malware-tampering/);

- Typography on the [subway](https://blog.prototypr.io/typography-on-the-subway-a-trip-around-the-world-463788a76a57);

- Clearing up the [callsign](https://blog.flightradar24.com/blog/clearing-up-call-sign-confusion/) confusion.
