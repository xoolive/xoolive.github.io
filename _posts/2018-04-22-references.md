# Pedagogy in Computer Science (mainly Python)

- Python Buffer protocol: the [PEP 3118](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3118/) and a human-oriented [explanation](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/05/introduction-to-the-python-buffer-protocol/);

- [Python and Qt examples](https://github.com/mfitzp/15-minute-apps), with Solitaire, Paint and Minesweeper in few lines of Python!


- I enjoyed the talk [Building Interactive Applications and Dashboards in the Jupyter Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i40d8-Hu4vM) by Bloomberg, esp. the presentation of their [`bqplot`](https://github.com/bloomberg/bqplot) tool. It is a shame that the notebook used in the presentation has not been released to the public. Yet it may have triggered a change of my mind about interactive visualisation in my daily routine, maybe...  
Keep in mind to have a look at [`traitlets`](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/) and [`pythreejs`](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/pythreejs);

- A great [set of zines](https://jvns.ca/zines/) by Julia Evans, explaining the all you need to know about Unix;  
(and even more)

- As I made the switch to Jupyter Lab and got a list of installed kernels long forgotten on the homepage, I did some quick update of my references.

    - [R](https://irkernel.github.io/) and [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) kernels look very mature now;
    - The latest [OCaml](https://akabe.github.io/ocaml-jupyter/) kernel is now much better than the previous state-of-the-art proof of concept. The repository comes with a set of notebooks for [Datascience in OCaml](https://github.com/akabe/docker-ocaml-jupyter-datascience);
    - Didn't try [Go](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes), [Haskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell), didn't find anything decent for Scala or Rust.  
    *Note to myself*: learn those languages first!

- The standard unix [password manager](https://www.passwordstore.org/) with browser extensions, smartphone applications and git repository integration. Since you will need a GPG key, check also [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/xoolive).

# Typography

- [The long, incredibly tortuous, and fascinating process of creating a Chinese font](https://qz.com/522079/the-long-incredibly-tortuous-and-fascinating-process-of-creating-a-chinese-font/);

- [Cursive handwring and other education myths](http://nautil.us/issue/40/learning/cursive-handwriting-and-other-education-myths);

- [*Shady Characters*](http://amzn.eu/b6jJG8V ), by Keith Houston,  
If it hadn't been written, I would have tried to start it! An investigation of the history of many characters, (and sometimes just a book of history). It covers the pilcrow ¶, the interrobang, the octothorpe #, the ampersand &, the @ character (with its multiple names), the asterisk ∗ and dagger †, the hyphen ‐, the dash –, the manicule ☞ and quotation marks “ ”.  
By the way, since we talk about quotation marks  ☞ [Has the Internet Killed Curly Quotes?](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/12/quotation-mark-wars/511766/)

# Fictions, non fictions

- [*Technically wrong*](http://amzn.eu/iqd3Smi) by Sara Wachter-Boettcher,  
No comment, just consider it ★★★★★

- Je viens de découvrir [Théodore Poussin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_Poussin) alors qu'on aurait presque le même âge !

- La webradio [Arte Radio](https://www.arteradio.com/) et ses podcasts: *Mycose the night* a démarré très, très fort !

- A good old sketch by the [Monty Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyHlMXpZrE8)
