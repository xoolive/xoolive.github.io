title: The zen of NumPy
---

Just found [here](http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.fr/2010/11/zen-of-numpy.html) an attempt to rewrite _The Zen of Python_ for NumPy.


> Strided is better than scattered  
> Contiguous is better than strided  
> Descriptive is better than imperative (use data-types)  
> Array-oriented is often better than object-oriented  
> Broadcasting is a great idea – use where possible  
> Vectorized is better than an explicit loop  
> Unless it’s complicated — then use numexpr, weave, or Cython  
> Think in higher dimensions


Couldn't agree more :)
