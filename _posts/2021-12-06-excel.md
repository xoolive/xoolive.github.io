title: Finding my way around Excel functions
---

I am really not a big fan of Excel but there are situations where I cannot avoid it. It becomes very frustrating to not be able to program all what I could do with Python/Pandas.

Today, I managed my way around with functions found on this [website](https://exceljet.net/formulas): my use cases revolved around:

- concatenating strings with the `&` operator;
- finding a line matching a regexp in a different sheet with `MATCH`;
- build up the string for a cell reference with `INDIRECT`.
