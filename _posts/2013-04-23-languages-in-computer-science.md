C for its roughness; rigid, implacable and requiring discipline.

Objective CamL for its discipline as well. It teaches the rigour you need in other languages like C. Love the lambda calculus.

[Ruby](http://rubykoans.com/) for its syntactic sugar. You just write few lines and run a nice simulation.

R for its convenience in parsing, plotting and analysing data. Everything is just in there!

LaTeX and TikZ for it's just beautiful!

Would love to learn more [Prolog](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) and [Clojure](http://clojurekoans.com/). Maybe Erlang and [Scala](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) also.
