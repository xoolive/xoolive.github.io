title: The monthly digest #09
---

It has been such a long time since last time I wrote a "monthly" digest that I
feel a bit guilty about this naming. Past weeks were rather crazy and I am happy
to see things cool down for this month, so let's not think too much about how we
name this page. Here goes:

# Programming

Call me old school, but I stick to this 80 character per line rule when I
program or write in my favourite text editor. [Nick
Janetakis](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/80-characters-per-line-is-a-standard-worth-sticking-to-even-today)
seems to agree with me.

Digging a bit into Python source code, there is long
[memo](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/listsort.txt) about
a particular sort called now "timsort". Enjoy reading about benchmarking basic
sorting algorithms taken right out from Algorithms 101, what I expect to read
from scientific articles, all in plain text! ;)

Talking about Python, Lisa Roach did a nice talk about how to extend GDB for
debugging Python. Slides are
[here](https://www.slideshare.net/LisaRoach3/extending-gdb-with-python), am
still searching for a video of the talk.

Other topic, other slides. [Ange
Albertini](https://speakerdeck.com/ange/lets-write-a-pdf-file) takes us into the
mysteries of the PDF format. More visualisation materials about many binary
formats are available on github [corkami/pics](https://github.com/corkami/pics).

Writing tests takes time, and as we are all lazy, we miss a lot of cornercases.
Static typing, and solutions like [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) in Python
help finding errors, but not writing better tests.
[Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) looks like a good
option for generating relevant unit tests. I did not have the opportunity to try
it yet, but that's somewhere in my todo list.

I still like Vim. Even teach Vim. But now that I gave it a try to [Visual
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), I take it to students. Shame me, I used
to ignore students' need for a decent UI by saying "do whatever you want". I
tried recently a full Python course and twisted students' arm into using code,
and I believe it was a success.

Here is my current plugin configuration:
[ms-python.python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
is installed automatically upon first edition of a Python file.
[ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
enables a smooth and transparent remote edition. Forget about fuse ssh mounts.
[vscodevim.vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim),
because of course.
[esbenp.prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
helps with the formatting and I still have to try
[MarkLarah.pre-commit-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MarkLarah.pre-commit-vscode)
for my most advanced projects.

Programming is also about music and generative music. There are some excellent
references out there. Maybe I'll just try an interactive notebook in my style on
this webpage one day. In the mean time, you may check [this
one](https://teropa.info/loop) for a first explanation, and this
[presentation](https://github.com/swallez/livecoding-webaudio-tonejs) using
[tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).

Other (potential) side projects for fun things to try when I have free time
again to play with Software Defined Radio: a full tutorial for [weather
satellite
reception](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-com-goes-16-17-and-gk-2a-weather-satellite-reception-comprehensive-tutorial/)
and a nice step-by-step Python code for [VOR
decoding](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/a-new-vor-decoder-written-in-python/).


# Visualisation


A notable book addition [Fundamentals of Data
Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/) with excellent examples, all
written using the R language but without any programming inside.

This github
[uwdata/visualization-curriculum](https://github.com/uwdata/visualization-curriculum)
gathers many valuable dataviz Jupyter notebooks. Note also the release of
[kepler.gl](https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl) for Jupyter Lab last summer!

Some nice visualisations randomly found over the net: a reworked map of [Paris
subway system](http://www.jugcerovic.com/metro/plan-grand-paris/) by Jug
Cerović, probably better than the original, and this New York Times essay on
[rising seas and cities under
water](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/29/climate/coastal-cities-underwater.html).

Finally, do not miss this [interview with Mona
Chalabi](https://medium.com/nightingale/power-to-the-powerless-an-interview-with-mona-chalabi-39d73647d80a)
who does great work at dataviz with political and societal motivations. Hats
off!

# Typefaces

A [guide to recognising font
styles](https://betterwebtype.com/articles/2019/07/14/recognising-font-styles/).
You probably know by now about serif, sans serif and monospace. Now you probably
should know who Garamond is, why some fonts are Grotesque and the history of
Futura. Not so unrelated, do not miss this TV series about
[Bauhaus](https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/RC-015430/bauhaus-un-temps-nouveau/) if
you can still make it when you find this page.

A nice finding of the summer was [Chris Gaul's
Medium](https://medium.com/@chrisgaul) with two papers about how prisoners in
Hong-Kong work on the city's signages and give them a [unique
touch](https://medium.com/@chrisgaul/prison-gothic-the-criminal-record-written-on-hong-kongs-road-signs-c54d655d55b5)
and [another
one](https://medium.com/@chrisgaul/tokyo-subways-humble-duct-tape-typographer-a8c84bb6b99b)
about Satō-san making Japanese characters with duck tape


# Miscellaneous

Finally, just ignore it for the time being: this is just an example of a
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) piece of code I wrote that happens to be
the most complex I did until today.  
The data comes from the [ICAO API data
service](https://www.icao.int/safety/istars/pages/api-data-service.aspx).

```sh
jq '.[] | select(.airportCode | startswith("LFB")) |
{icao: .airportCode, city: .cityName, airport: .airportName} |
join (", ")' airports.json
```

which returns

```
"LFBO, Toulouse, Blagnac"
"LFBT, Tarbes, Lourdes-Pyrenees"
"LFBP, Pau/Pyrenees, Pau/Pyrenees"
"LFBH, La Rochelle, Ile De Re"
"LFBI, Poitiers, Biard"
"LFBZ, Biarritz, Bayonne-Anglet"
"LFBD, Bordeaux, Merignac"
```
