Know yourself, respect yourself, be gentle with yourself.

Have fun at work (while working!) then take yet another break.

Let it go, it's not worth it.

Listen to the sound of your breathing.

Nothing is more precious than your time.

Sleep early, get up early.

Preserve your work environment.

You never learn better than when you are preparing to teach.

Avoid the "no", keep quiet, just listen.

Be grateful, everyday.
