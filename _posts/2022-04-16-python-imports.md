---

It is very easy to get drifted as you write your Python library and let your
library import just everything instead of sticking to a more efficient
import-as-you-need approach.

The following command lines with the `tuna` command.

```bash
python -X importtime -c "from package import module" 2> import.log
tuna import.log
```
