---

Food lover, cook  
Coffee & tea enthusiast

Bookworm, language savvy  
Believe in people, doubt science not knowledge

Avoid Office suites, conserve capital letters but use diacritics and semicolons

Strongly believe that form should not yield to substance

I thrive in dynamic and disruptive environments; enjoy research, sharing and teaching.
