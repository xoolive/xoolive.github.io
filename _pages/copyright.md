# Requests

If you consider I violated some rights of any kind, please

1. Keep calm and have a deep breath;
2. File an issue [here](https://github.com/xoolive/xoolive.github.io/issues);
3. Have a tea, and wait until I contact you back.  

I usually reply within 48 hours.

Be assured I did not intend to act in a deceitful manner, so I am sure we will find a solution.
