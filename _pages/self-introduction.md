My name is Xavier Olive.  
If you are interested in my work activities, please have a look [here](https://linkedin.com/in/xoolive).

# Interests

Outside office hours, I love to learn new things, especially when it comes to:

  - foreign cultures and languages,
  - music, particularly jazz and bossa nova,
  - acupuncture, yoga, cooking,
  - independent cinema.

On this website, I write about anything that crosses my mind on that specific day.  
It may not be relevant to you, and even to myself when I read it again.

# Fun facts

I collect translations of *Le Petit Prince*.  
You can check the current status of my collection [here](/le-petit-prince).
