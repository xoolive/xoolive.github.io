# Teaching activities

I teach mostly programming, optimisation and machine learning techniques.  
I regularly visit [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) (Toulouse campus) and [ENSTA Paris](http://ensta-paris.fr/) (Palaiseau campus).

- **Python programming**: advanced and idiomatic programming practices. I teach a [7 full-day course](/pyclass), oriented on data analysis and Geographical Information Systems.

- **Algorithms and programming**, with a focus on data structures, algorithms and their implementations using the C language.

- **Optimisation for Artificial Intelligence**: a 4 full-day illustrated [course](/optim4ai) covering Non Linear Programming, Linear and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, [Constraint Programming](/constraints) and Metaheuristics. I also teach a class on [optimisation in graphs](https://github.com/xoolive/graphs);

- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: occasional short classes about supervised or unsupervised approaches, with a focus on my area of expertise in anomaly detection;

- A **study case** focused on transportation and environment, with [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/) data, [traffic](https://traffic-viz.github.io/) and [OpenAP](https://openap.dev/).
