# Teaching activities

I teach mostly programming, optimisation and machine learning techniques at [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) and [ENSTA Paris](http://ensta-paris.fr/). Lectures I am in charge of include:

- **Python programming**, as a "back on track" seminar at the beginning of academic year, and also as a 7 full-day course, with a specialisation on geographical information systems.
- **Constraint Programming**, 10 hours to cover theory and practice on a realistic example

I am also part of the lecturing team for:

- **Algorithmic and programming**, covering data structures and algorithms with the C language.
- **Data and decision Sciences**, covering most constraint optimisation techniques over a 3-year cursus (linear programming, mixed integer linear programming, constraint programming, metaheuristics) and a study case in energy and transportation.
