# Teaching activities

I teach mostly programming, optimisation and machine learning techniques at [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) and [ENSTA Paris](http://ensta-paris.fr/). Lectures I am in charge of include:

- **Python programming**, as a ["back on track" seminar](https://xolearn.github.io/back2python) at the beginning of academic year, and also as a [7 full-day course](https://github.com/xolearn/scientificpython), with a specialisation on Geographical Information Systems.

- [**Constraint Programming**](https://xolearn.github.io/constraints), 10 hours to cover theory and practice on a realistic example

I am also part of the lecturing team for:

- **Algorithmic and programming**, covering data structures and algorithms with the C language.

- **Data and decision Sciences**, covering most constraint optimisation techniques over a 3-year cursus (linear programming, mixed integer linear programming, [constraint programming](https://xolearn.github.io/constraints), [metaheuristics](https://github.com/xolearn/metaheuristics), [graphs](https://github.com/xolearn/graphs)) and a study case in energy and transportation.
