# Teaching activities

I teach mostly programming, optimisation and machine learning technique.  
I regularly visit [ISAE SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/en/) (Toulouse campus) and [ENSTA Paris](http://ensta-paris.fr/) (Palaiseau campus).

- **Python programming**: advanced and idiomatic programming practices.

  - an [intermediate-level seminar](/pyseminar) designed for three sessions, with a fair share of self-training;
  - a [7 full-day course](https://github.com/xolearn/scientificpython), more oriented on data analysis and Geographical Information Systems.

- **Algorithms and programming**, with a focus on data structures, algorithms and their implementations using the C language.

- **Optimisation topics**:

  - a [4 full-day course](), _Optimisation Topics for Artificial Intelligence_

  - [Constraint Programming](/constraints): theory, hands-on session and project on realistic examples;
  - Mixed-Integer Linear Programming;
  - [Optimisation in graphs](https://github.com/xoolive/graphs);
  - [Metaheuristics](https://github.com/xoolive/metaheuristics) (discontinued);

- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: supervised and unsupervised approaches

- **Applied study cases** focused on transportation and energy.
