## Open access projects (open source, open data)

- The [traffic](https://traffic-viz.github.io/) library provides data
  analysis methods commonly applied to trajectories and airspaces. It offers
  facilities to parse and/or access traffic data from open sources of ADS-B
  traffic like the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/).
  It is designed to be easily extendable to other sources of data.

- The [tangram](https://github.com/open-aviation/tangram) project is a modular
   platform for real-time geospatial and air traffic management research. Built on
   a plugin-first architecture with a high-performance backend (Python & Rust) and
   modern web frontend (Vue & Deck.gl), it enables visualization and analysis of
   moving entities with low latency. While focused on air traffic management, the
   core framework is generic and adaptable to any domain.

- The [open aviation data](https://atmdata.github.io/) initiative intends to
  reference any kind of (possibly open) data initiative related to aviation. It is
  supported by a group of academics, researchers and aviation people working to
  bring the power of data in order to improve the current state of the art in
  aviation.

- I am pretty active within the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/),
  a non-profit association aiming at improving the security, reliability and
  efficiency of the air space usage by providing open access of real-world air
  traffic control data to the public.
