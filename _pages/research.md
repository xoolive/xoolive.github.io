# Research interests

My research interests include Data Science, Machine Learning and Decision Science applied to aviation, with a particular focus on optimisation, anomaly and pattern detection.  
Applications range from air traffic management, operations, predictive maintenance, safety analyses and risk assessment.

## Open access projects (open source, open data)

<p><img class="logo_traffic" src="https://github.com/xoolive/traffic/raw/master/docs/_static/logo_traffic.png" /></p>

- The [traffic](https://traffic-viz.github.io/) library provides data
  analysis methods commonly applied to trajectories and airspaces. It offers
  facilities to parse and/or access traffic data from open sources of ADS-B
  traffic like the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/).  
  It is designed to be easily extendable to other sources of data.

- The [open aviation data](https://atmdata.github.io/) initiative intends to
  reference any kind of (possibly open) data initiative related to aviation. It is
  supported by a group of academics, researchers and aviation people working to
  bring the power of data in order to improve the current state of the art in
  aviation.

- I am pretty active within the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/),
  a non-profit association aiming at improving the security, reliability and
  efficiency of the air space usage by providing open access of real-world air
  traffic control data to the public.
