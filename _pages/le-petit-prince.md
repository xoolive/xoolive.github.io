# Le Petit Prince

The first contact I had with _Le Petit Prince_ was in 1991, as we read the stories of the lamplighter and of the fox at school. I read the whole story **much** later, in 2004. About the same time, I discovered that this book has been the most translated work on Earth after the _Bible_.  
This was enough for me to start a collection.

I bought some of these books during trips around the world. Some were offered by friends on many occasions. I will try to keep track of the story of each book on this page.
