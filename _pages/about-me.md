I am a <span style="color: #9a3334; font-weight: 600">research scientist</span>, passionate about <span style="color: #9a3334; font-weight: 600">aviation, maps and data</span>.

My research interests include Data Science, Machine Learning and Decision Science applied to aviation, with a particular focus on optimisation, anomaly and pattern detection. Applications range from air traffic management, operations, predictive maintenance, safety analyses and risk assessment.

Outside office hours, I love to learn new things, especially when it comes to:

- foreign cultures and languages,
- music: jazz, bossa nova;
- trail running, meditation and yoga;
- radio waves and broadcasting, independent cinema.
