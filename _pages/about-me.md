I am a research scientist, passionate about aviation, maps and data.  
For a decent idea of my work activities, have a look at my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/xoolive) profile.

Outside office hours, I love to learn new things, especially when it comes to:

  - foreign cultures and languages,
  - music, particularly jazz and bossa nova,
  - yoga, cooking, independent cinema.

# Teaching activities

- Algorithms and Programming, with a focus on data structures and their
    implementation
- Python for Scientists, advanced and idiomatic programming practices
- Decision Science, incl. graph optimisation, constraint programming or linear
    programming
- Data Science, Machine Learning, esp. unsupervised learning

# Open-source projects


- The [traffic](https://traffic-viz.github.io/) library provides data
analysis methods commonly applied to trajectories and airspaces. It offers
facilities to parse and/or access traffic data from open sources of ADS-B
traffic like the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/).  
It is designed to be easily extendable to other sources of data.

- The [open aviation data](https://atmdata.github.io/) initiative intends to
reference any kind of (possibly open) data initiative related to aviation. It is
supported by a group of academics, researchers and aviation people working to
bring the power of data in order to improve the current state of the art in
aviation.

- I am pretty active within the [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/),
a non-profit association aiming at improving the security, reliability and
efficiency of the air space usage by providing open access of real-world air
traffic control data to the public.
